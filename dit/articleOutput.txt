messiah hwv 561n 1 is an english-language oratorio composed in 1741 by george frideric handel with a scriptural text compiled by charles jennens from the king james bible and from the coverdale psalter the version of the psalms included with the book of common prayer it was first performed in dublin on 13 april 1742 and received its london premiere nearly a year later after an initially modest public reception the oratorio gained in popularity eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in western music

handels reputation in england where he had lived since 1712 had been established through his compositions of italian opera he turned to english oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste messiah was his sixth work in this genre although its structure resembles that of opera it is not in dramatic form there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech instead jennenss text is an extended reflection on jesus as the messiah called christ the text begins in part i with prophecies by isaiah and others and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds the only scene taken from the gospels in part ii handel concentrates on the passion and ends with the hallelujah chorus in part iii he covers the resurrection of the dead and christs glorification in heaven

handel wrote messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces with optional settings for many of the individual numbers in the years after his death the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale with giant orchestras and choirs in other efforts to update it its orchestration was revised and amplified such as mozarts der messias in the late 20th and early 21st centuries the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to handels original intentions although big messiah productions continue to be mounted a near-complete version was issued on 78 rpm discs in 1928 since then the work has been recorded many times
